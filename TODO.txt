Use smaller sections of background, made bigger, and give the impression that you are 'zooming out' when you are really just switching backgrounds to the one with more rings showing. Then have all enemies respawn, and add 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 points, depending on the level
DONT SCALE BAD GUYS
w=5693
h=3552

Make other enemies as slow as cirlce by using short paths, and lots (~1500) frames for the 2 keyframes, with a pasted pencil path on top
Speed up smaller enemies by calculating how big they are (how much above 100 for scalefactor), and then having them skip every 1,2,3,etc frames to speed up
Change goodguy animation so there is one for each enemy, fix up animations

NEED TO FIX SIDE BLOCKS
Check scaling more than once
Work on speed change depending on size

FIX EDGES - need to find perfect amount
FIX DYING - LIVES RUN OUT BUT YOU DON'T DIE!
ADD LETTERS that grow and shrink on screen (flash in and out) when going to the next stage

Q toggle for lock not working

DONE!
